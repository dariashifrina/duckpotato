Today, we were introduced to C for the first time. We started off by contrasting Java and C. Unlike C, Java provides a JVM(java virtual machine) that compiles your code to run in different computing environments. In C, you do not have a virtual machine so you must manually recompile when switching between operating systems.

Then, we learned that there are several conventions when it comes to C:
* Put in .c files
* snake_case 
Ex: black_mamba.c

We also learned how to compile a C file. One "inconvenience" of C is that it doesn't recognize your file name when you compile the code, instead creating an output file called "a.out", which stands for "assembler output." There are ways to change that output file name. Here's an example of what you'd write in your terminal if you were trying to compile black_mamba.c:
<blockquote>
    $ gcc black_mamba.c #Creates a.out files  
    
    $ ./a.out #output of black_mamba.c  
   
    $ gcc -o snake black_mamba.c #rename a.out to snake  
   
    $ ./snake #output of black_mamba.c
</blockquote>
